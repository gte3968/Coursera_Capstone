I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Silicon Valley is situated. Like any other areas, there are variations location to 
location in demographics and economy, among others. It would be handy to have an easy by-zip code view of the basic information such as 
population, ethnicity distribution, housing price, per capita income, crime rate, school rating, and business concentratrations (e.g., 
which zip code has most Chinese restrants ) etc for the bay area. This would give researchers, government agencies, residents and business 
owners direct and quantitative insights into each zip code. As a result this will help facilitate understaning of the area, goverment 
planning, exploring the area or choosing a place to live as a resident, and business decisions such as where is the best location to open 
an Asian restaurant.

In this project, due to the scope limiation and data availability, only a small subset of the aforementioned data will be included, which 
is summarized in the next section.

From online search, I have collected the following datasets: 
•	All zip codes of the bay area 
https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-ZIP-Codes/u5j3-svi6

•	Latitudes and longitudes for all zip codes in California 
https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/

•	Population by zip code for California (2019)
https://www.california-demographics.com/zip_codes_by_population

•	US nation-wide monthly housing price data by zip code : US (1996-2020) 
https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

•	California’s by zip code tax data from IRS (2017) 
https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2017-zip-code-data-soi

•	Foursquare data via API calls to Foursquare.com
https://developer.foursquare.com

Only a portion of each data file has the data of interest. Therefore data merge and cleaning is done first to 
generate the master pandas Dataframe that contains zip code, latitude, longtitude, population, per capita income, 
housing price. Additional data columns will be added during the data analysis.

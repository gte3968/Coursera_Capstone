    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Silicon Valley is situated. Like any other areas, there are variations location to location in demographics and economy, among others. It would be handy to have an easy by-zip code view of the basic information such as population, ethnicity distribution, housing price, per capita income, crime rate, school rating, and business concentratrations (e.g., which zip code has most Chinese restrants ) etc for the bay area. This would give researchers, government agencies, residents and business owners direct and quantitative insights into each zip code. As a result this will help facilitate understaning of the area, goverment planning, exploring the area or choosing a place to live as a resident, and business decisions such as where is the best location to open an Asian restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, due to the scope limiation and data availability, only a small subset of the aforementioned data will be included, which is summarized in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "From online search, I have collected the following datasets: \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAll zip codes of the bay area \n",
    "https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Bay-Area-ZIP-Codes/u5j3-svi6\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLatitudes and longitudes for all zip codes in California \n",
    "https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPopulation by zip code for California (2019)\n",
    "https://www.california-demographics.com/zip_codes_by_population\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tUS nation-wide monthly housing price data by zip code : US (1996-2020) \n",
    "https://www.zillow.com/research/data/\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCalifornia’s by zip code tax data from IRS (2017) \n",
    "https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2017-zip-code-data-soi\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFoursquare data via API calls to Foursquare.com\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only a portion of each data file has the data of interest, the data merge and cleaning are done first to \n",
    "generate the master pandas Dataframe that contains zip code, latitude, longtitude, population, and housing price. Additional data columns are then further added, such as per capita income calculated from the total income of the zip code from the IRS data file and the population for each zip code. Some columns have the wrong data type for analysis, which was also corrected. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the master pandas dataframe looks like this with total of 171 rows for 171 zip codes:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Methodology\n",
    "First I check the distribution of the three parameters, population, housing price, and per capita income, as shown below.\n",
    "<img src=\"Pop_house_income_hist.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly thre is an outlier for both housing price and income. It is from a single zip code 94027, which is the city of Atherton. It is ranked not only in California, but nationwide among the wealthiest zip codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Pop_house_income_hist2.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I checked the corrleation beween population, income and housing prices. To my surprise, the correlation between income and housing prices is low, only 0.36. A scatter plot showed there is an outlier on income. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"IncomeVsHousing1.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the outlier, the correlation becomes 0.82, as shown below. This also means that for further analysis, only one of the two parameters, income and housing price, should be sufficient. I picked per capita income for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"IncomeVsHousing2.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since for certain users, for example, a business owner,  population and per capita income of an area are two critical parameters, as they provide information regarding how large the potential market of the area is, as well as how strong the spending power is. Therefore, I'll further into more details into these two parameters in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Results\n",
    "In an attempt to gain some insights into whether population and per capita income form any clusters, I tried two clustering methods: K-Means and DBSAN. \n",
    "\n",
    "For K-Means, the number of clusters k are scanned from 1 to 10, and based on the elbow plot, k = 2 was chosen to run the clustering. The result below shows that it lacks differentiation for both parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"KMeans clustering.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, DBSCAN clustering was tried. Total of 3 clusters are visible with a few outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"DBSCAN clustering.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, as can be seen, the data are more continuously distributed rathter than forming clear clusters. Since I was interested in finer granularity of the binning, I've decided to skip the clustering results, and resort to manually defined ranges for popoulation, income and housing prices as below. Total 4 bins were defined for each of the three paramters using the intervals between the 5 numbers for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"PopIncomeHousePriceBins.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The income and population distribution is agains plotted based on the binned data as below. each number and the size of the data point denote the number of zip codes falling in the corresponding combined income_population bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"IncomeVsPopulationBin.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 dots corresponding to population_income bin of 2_2, 2_3, 3_2, and 3_3 are of more interest than the rest of the area, because they have combinations of relatively higher income and higher population, which could be better areas to consider opending a business. There are a total of 32 zip codes in this bucket. These zip codes of interest are highlighted using blue dots in the map below of the bay area zip codes, whereas the remaining zip codes are in gray. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ZipAndInterest.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the labeling of the bins for each parameter, maps are generated as below displaying the zip codes, and zip codes plus the color coded bins of population, income, and housing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ZipAndPopulationMap.PNG\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"ZipAndIncomeMap.PNG\" />\n",
    "<img src=\"ZipAndHousingMap.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "From the maps it is evident that the west and south bay areas have higher income than the east and north of they bay area. This is undestandable because west and south of the bay areas are closer to the center of the Silicon Valley, where many high tech companies with high income employees are highly concentrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the maps are providing direct visual display for all the zip codes in the are for a few fundamental information, which are relavant for both residents and business owners to get a quick idea about the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next I tried to use Foursqure API calls to get some further data about each zip code. Due to the limited number of calls available for the free account on Foursquare website, I had constrained the range of the search around the center of each zip code to a small range. i.e., within a radius of 1000 meters from the ceter of each zip code, and only searched within the 32 zip codes of interest mentioned above. The search returned 10 zip codes with venues. One reason that some zip codes did not return any venue could be that the center of the zip code in longitude and latitude may not be a location with businesses nearby. Further improvements can be made to search the whole zip code area, instead of using the center's longitude and latitude and a radius. This is outside the scope of this project. With further processing, the returned venues are subgrouped by different high level venue categories, such as food, shops, travel etc. The summary table is shown below for the 10 zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"returnedZIP.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the last two zip codes contain very few number of venues, thus are dropped. As an example, assuming someone is interested in opending a food related business, the table is then sorted by total number of venues and the number of food venues with other venues dropped:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"RankedZIP.PNG\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the final 8 zip codes, which are from relatively high population, high income, and high number of venues thus more likely to attract customers. Further comaprisons can be made within the 8 zip codes. For example, the top 2 zip codes, 94596 and 94403, both have 100 venues, but 94596 have nearly double food venues compared to 94403. This suggest 94403 zip code may have less competition than 94596, among other factors to be considered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The 8 zip codes are displayed on the map below with zip codes, total venues (within 1000 meters of center of the zip code), and number of food venues displayed on the clickable markers. These are the candidate zip codes for someone interested in opending a food related business in the bay area. Obviously this can be extended to other categories.\n",

    "### 5. Conclusion and Remarks\n",
    "In this project, some location based data, namely, population, per capita income, and housing price, were collected for all the zip codes of the San Francisco bay area. The zip codes are categorized into 4 bins for each of the 3 parameters, and displayed on the map for all zip codes with color coded clickable mark denoting each zip with the corresponding data for the category of interest, i.e., population, income, and housing price. Further information regarding a relevant business type, i.e., Asian food, was pulled from Foursqure API calls, and added to each zip code, as an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project can be further refined with more data incorporated. For example, the population distribution by ethnicity varies from zip code to zip code and from city to city. For instance, it would make more sense to open an Asian restaurant in an area with more Asian population. Other data that can be added include location based crime rate, traffic data etc. Another area of opportunity is that zip codes are not necessarily overlapped with city limits, as it was designed by USPS for their mail delivery purpose and thus some zip codes include very rural areas [1]. Further refining into neighborhood level would improve the accuracy of the clusters. Such data wasn’t found from publicly available data, but can be purchased. One more useful extension is to add the population for a given radius around a point of interest, which is also a key factor for a business owner. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Silicon Valley is situated. Like any other areas, there are variations location to location in demographics and economy, among others. It would be handy to have an easy by-zip code view of the basic information such as population, ethnicity distribution, housing price, per capita income, crime rate, school rating, and business concentratrations (e.g., which zip code has most Chinese restrants ) etc for the bay area. This would give researchers, government agencies, residents and business owners direct and quantitative insights into each zip code. As a result this will help facilitate understaning of the area, goverment planning, exploring the area or choosing a place to live as a resident, and business decisions such as where is the best location to open an Asian restaurant.\n",
